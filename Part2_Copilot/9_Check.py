# Please write a program which asks for the user's age.
# If the age is not plausible, that is, it is under 5 or something that can't be an actual human age,
# the program should print out a comment.

# Have a look at the examples of expected behaviour below to figure out which comment is applicable in each case.

# Sample output
# What is your age? 13
# Ok, you're 13 years old

# Sample output
# What is your age? 2
# I suspect you can't write quite yet...

# Sample output
# What is your age? -4
# That must be a mistake

# Write your code here:
age = int(input("what is your age?"))
if age < 0:
    print("I haven't had enough coffee to deal with time travel yet")
elif age < 5:
    print(" The human head weighs 8 pounds")
else:
    print("ok, you're", age, "years old")
